# ai-anime-gan
Features an advanced AI anime face generator built with Keras and TensorFlow, using Generative Adversarial Networks GANs. This model has been trained on the 'Anime Faces' dataset from Kaggle, demonstrating the use of deep learning in anime character generation.

### Dataset

You can download the dataset of anime faces from Kaggle and unzip the folder in the code's directory.
